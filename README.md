Product,Pricing,Media,Inventory and PO web service consumption examples in Yii


I have chosen the Yii framework for these examples as we at Hit extensively use it and php without a framework, is not too nice to work with. I have tried to write the code concise and descreptive as possible.

Please reach out if you have any questions or concerns.
